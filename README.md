# Avalonia `DataGrid`

The `DataGrid` control was initially ported from Silverlight, and was previously part of the [Avalonia main repository](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia).  
It now lives in the current repository: see [this discussion](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/discussions/18388) for details.
