# Avalonia DataGrid

## About

The official `DataGrid` control for [Avalonia](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia).  

It displays repeating data in a customizable grid.  
See the [documentation](https://docs.avaloniaui.net/docs/reference/controls/datagrid/) for more information.

## Status

The `DataGrid` control was initially ported from Silverlight, and was previously part of the [Avalonia main repository](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia).  
It now lives in its [own repository](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia.Controls.DataGrid): see [this discussion](https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia/discussions/18388) for details.
